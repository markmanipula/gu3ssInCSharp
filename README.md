I played this game with a friend and got inspired into building it into a console based application.

The game is simple, all you need to do is figure out the different codes (0~9) and their position generated by game system.
When the code is correct and in its position, then the system will give you (1A).
If the code is correct but not in the right position, then the system will give you (1B).
Game system will tell you how many(1A) or (1B) you got, right after your every guess.
